BMI Wikipedia Page

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

BMI Formula

NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.

Example Input 1
1.75
80
means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75

Example Output 1
26
Since: 80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

Example Input 2
1.58
57
Example Output 1
22

"""

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input("Enter height")
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input("Enter weight")

weight = int(weight)
height = float(height)

# Using the exponent operator
bmi = weight / height ** 2
print(bmi)

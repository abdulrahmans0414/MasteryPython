Instructions
You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 1 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

NOTE: Don't worry about getting hold of the input(), we've done the work behind the scenes to import everything.

HINT: Assume that names looks like this: input: x, y, z, names = ["x", "y", "z"]

Example Input
Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

Example Output
Michael is going to buy the meal today!
Hints
You might need the help of the len() function. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1712227/how-do-i-get-the-number-of-elements-in-a-list

Remember that Lists start at index 0!

"""
names_string = input("Enter name")
# The code above converts the input into an array seperating
#each name in the input by a comma and space.
names = names_string.split(", ")

import random

# Get the total number of items in list.
num_items = len(names)
# Generate random numbers between 0 and the last index. 
random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1)
# Choose and print a random name.
print(names[random_choice])

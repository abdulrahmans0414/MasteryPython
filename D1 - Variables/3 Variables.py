# pyhthon variables
# Learn to store values in containers for later use. Variables is a concept in programming that allows us to give a label to a piece of data so that we can refer or reference that data using the chosen variable name. We will see in this lesson how to create variables and how to use the variables to access the contained value.

name = "Abdul"
print(name)

name ="Rahman"
print(name)


# print(len (input("What is your name ?")))
name = input("What is your name?")
length = len(name)
print(length)
